Text2Links picks up within more than one hundred destinations’ keywords, turning your matched words into links to your implementation on Booking.com

== Description ==

**Links as they should be**

Text2link is the Booking.com Wordpress plugin that makes it easy for you to increase bookings - automatically replacing destination names with Booking.com affiliate deep-links.
This replaces the old method, whereby you could only use the Links tool. More than 100 of the top dest.
The plugin automatically finds destination names in your content and replaces them with deep-links to the equivalent landing pages on Booking.com.

**Smart linking**

To avoid repetitions, only the first of more identical destination names in the same paragraph becomes a deep-link. For example, see the below:
“Rome (Italian: Roma), the Eternal City, is the capital and largest city of Italy and of the Lazio region. Rome, as a millennium-long centre of power, culture (having been the cradle of one of the globe's greatest civilisations ever) and religion, has exerted a huge influence over the world in its roughly 2800 years of existence.” Via Wikitravel
In this example, only the first “Rome” will deep-link to the Booking.com landing page for Rome, avoiding your website appearing spammy.
Text2Link automatically finds and replaces destination names in all your published content. You don’t have to do anything, even your existing content will be scanned.
If you want to exclude a specific page or post, you can do so in the plugin settings.
